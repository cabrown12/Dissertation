Bayesian Surprise Classifier â€“ MA Crossover Strategy Performance

This repository contains visual performance summaries for the moving average (MA) crossover strategies evaluated in my undergraduate dissertation: Enhancing Systematic Trading Strategies with Bayesian Surprise Signals from Implied Volatility.

Overview

Each image in this repository displays the backtested performance of a specific MA crossover strategy, both with and without the integration of a Bayesian surprise signal derived from options market implied volatility.

The strategies are tested across multiple FX pairs and stock indices. Results are broken down by asset and crossover type (e.g. 5/13, 13/25, 20/50, 50/100), and include both:

Cumulative returns over time
Comparative plots for baseline vs surprise-enhanced strategies
These visualisations support the quantitative analysis discussed in the dissertation, helping demonstrate the impact of volatility-driven surprise signals on trend-following systems.
